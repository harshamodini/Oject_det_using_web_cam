# object_detection_using_yolo_in_video_and_webcam
this is to detect objects in an video or by use of webcam using opencv, yolo and python 

this is a program to detect objects in an video using YOLO algorithm 
This program is for object detection using YOLO.

Yolo is a deep learning algorithm that came out in May 2016 and it became quickly so popular because it’s so fast compared with the previous deep learning algorithm.

Opencv: also OpenCV has a deep learning framework that works with YOLO. Just make sure you have OpenCV 3.4.2 at least.

Advantage: it works without needing to install anything except OpenCV.

Disadvantage: it only works with CPU, so you can’t get really high speed to process videos in real time



#note:-
# to download yolov3.weights go the drive link below 

also if you want to use just webcam replce test.mp4 with 0
an remove 
// fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"XVID")
// out = cv2.VideoWriter("the_new_video_is.avi", fourcc , 25, (852, 480))
